# AntiIdle Save Manager

This batch file is commented if you want to investigate the code with a simple explanation. I *recommend* reading it, in fact.

It uses a unique technique to automate finding the save file folder, which in Google Chrome is obfuscated using a random string of alphanumeric symbols.

It is as simple to use as just run, select “backup” and play with peace of mind that your saves are safe. 
If at any time you need to restore, it does that just as easy.

It also doesn’t install anything on your computer, it just makes a folder in your documents folder to house the backups. 
I also advise you store the batch file there.
