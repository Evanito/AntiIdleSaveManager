## About:
This batch file primarily is used to easily backup and restore your Anti-Idle save files. It keeps them safe in your documents folder, and requires no configuration or computer knowledge to use. It supports Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox, with autodetection of which browser you use.
I will update the file through GitHub if I wish to add a new feature or if AntiIdle changes its save mechanics.
You can see what features I have planned by visiting the GitHub wiki page: https://github.com/Evanito/AntiIdleSaveManager/wiki/Possible-Future-Features

The batch file is commented if you want to investigate the code with a simple explanation. I *recommend* reading it, in fact.

It is as simple to use as just run, select “backup” and play with peace of mind that your saves are safe. 
If at any time you need to restore, it does that just as easily. (Just remember to close the game before restoring, or else the saves will be lost.)

It also doesn’t install anything on your computer, it only makes a folder in your documents folder to house the backups. 
It is also recommended to store the batch file there.

Pull requests through GitHub are encouraged if you wish to help expand its features.
